## Welcome to WLASL Homepage
WLASL is the <b>largest video dataset for Word-Level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition</b>, which features 2,000 common different words in ASL. We hope WLASL will facilitate the research in sign language understanding and eventually benefit the communication between deaf and hearing communities.
